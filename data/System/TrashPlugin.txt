%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

This plugin lets you empty the trash bin on a regular base or immediately on request.
By default deleting a topic, an attachment or a web, items are moved to the [[%TRASHWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%]].
It will stay there for recovery until the trash is emptied. Cleaning up the trash bin will wipe out items and their history from the
store permanently, that is the operation can't be reverted anymore, even not by checking out a previous revision.

For this reason cleaning up the trash can only be performed by an admin user under the assumption they know better
what they are doing.

---++ Installation Instructions
